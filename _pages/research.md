Philosophy of experimental economics
=========
   
I study the methodological and practical principles guiding the experimental method in economics (especially lab experiments), comparing with other disciplines such as psychology.   
   
My research is in line with the work of [Guala (2005)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/methodology-of-experimental-economics/1333D78666AE8C93062FB80AF0A41CCC), [Bardsley & *al* (2009)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691124797/experimental-economics) and [Hausman (2023)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/inexact-and-separate-science-of-economics/D72C7ED18808BB691895934A9881740B). In particular, I focus on experiments giving rise to "social preference" models, such as the dictator game or the ultimatum game.

History of experimental economics  
==========
   
I investigate the local history of experimental economics within a french laboratory in Strasbourg. My research is based on historical archives and interviews conducted with members of the economics laboratory under study.
   
Major works have already been dedicated to the history of experimental economics [Svorenčík (2015)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2560026) and behavioral economics [Heukelom (2014)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/behavioral-economics/behavioral-economics-a-history/5FA5BE1B3DD59A52BC0BBDD347026BE2) in the US. Fewer studies have recently focused on the development of french experimental economics at the national level such as [Serra (2022)](https://www.pulm.fr/index.php/default/la-revolution-experimentale-en-economie-numerique.html) and [(Jullien & Truc, 2024)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09672567.2024.2415000).
